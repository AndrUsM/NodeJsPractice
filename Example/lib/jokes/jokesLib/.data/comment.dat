I became the unfortunate owner of a laptop lenovo 320 i!

Before the new year my laptop broke! 
I draw in Corel, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.! 
It was only 40K to buy a new one! According to my requests, 
I sold the LENOVO ideapad 320 laptop model for 33,000 rubles !!!!! 
store in Golden Park on Kurchatov 1, Novosibirsk RBT !!!! closest to home! 
and what to do with it now? How to use a stand for a cipher ??? 
It does not work at all! already instead of the hard disk put the SSD! 
I tried to solve his brakes using the installation of Windows 7!
