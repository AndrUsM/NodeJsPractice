    <h2>About profession:</h2>
    <img class = "img" src="public/images/aboutImage.png" alt="" style = "height: 270px;">
    <p>A computer programmer, sometimes called more recently a coder (especially in more informal contexts), 
      is a person who creates computer software. The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers,
      or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. The generalist programmers aren't required to have any knowledge 
      of the fields and of the problems that the users want to solve or of the tasks to automate. This is the job of the analysts, 
      people who act as interfaces between the field practitioners and the programmers. When the analysis is done, 
     the analysts create some kind of symbolic description of the system using languages like UML, 
     blueprints that the programmers use to build the computer software. Sometimes, especially when the domain of the problems 
     aren't much complex and the working groups are small, analysis, system design, and coding are carried out by programmer analyst.</p>
